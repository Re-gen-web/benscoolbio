I had got access to s&box a month ago, and while it has its issues, I love it. I love it so much. If you never heard of it, go check it out [here]. While I love the game, there are some controversial stuff floating in it, and I will give my unwanted and unneeded opinion about some of this stuff.
## Sausage Men
These are the player models for S&box.

They clearly need some work, but they are better then generic humanoids. A lot of people hate on them for being ugly, but I kinda like them. As Garry says in his blog:
*I tend to think that a lot of people have the general feeling that real looking people are nicer than good looking people. That's why it's always such a surprise when someone good looking isn't a complete arshole, suprising enough to tell people that they aren't an arshole. Because the assumption is that good looking people are arsholes.*
